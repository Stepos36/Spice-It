_This app allows the user to search different ingredients and obtain recipes. Along with recipes, the **user is able to search required ingredients on Amazon Fresh**. With this information the user can easily order the ingredients and have a spicy meal_

The idea was formed from a small group of students at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. 

The app has a sleek clear and easy design for any user to easily follow and get great recipes along with step by step instructions and videos to help walk you through your culinary excursion. 

After you have chosen the recipe, the last step you need is the ingreidents. By using AmazonFresh marketplace we were able to generate a request to amazon to populate a cart with all the ingredients necessary to create the prefect dish
