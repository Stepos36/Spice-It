## Summary

_This app allows the user to search different ingredients and obtain recipes. Along with recipes, the **user is able to search required ingredients on Amazon Fresh**. With this information the user can easily order the ingredients and have a spicy meal_

The idea was formed from a small group of students at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. 

The app has a sleek clear and easy design for any user to easily follow and get great recipes along with step by step instructions and videos to help walk you through your culinary excursion. 

After you have chosen the recipe, the last step you need is the ingreidents. By using AmazonFresh marketplace we were able to generate a request to amazon to populate a cart with all the ingredients necessary to create the prefect dish

## Description

After you create an account and log in, type a dish name or some keyword into the search input and press the search button.
Once you see the card with desired recipe, click on it and you'll be transferred to the second page.

On this page you'll see a full-size picture of your dish, full preparation description, list of ingredients, a YouTube video
that contains some history of that recipe and the preparation process **and the main part - "Shop with Amazon Fresh" button**.

Once you click on that button, you'll be transferred to the Amazon Fresh website and all necessary ingredients for your dish
will be displayed on your screen. All you need to do is just put them in your cart and checkout.
